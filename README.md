# My Portfolio

This portofolio was created by using HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.
It is a single page site that contains a little section about me, skills, and a link to my resume; followed by a few projects I have worked on and the links to my github, Linkedin and section for guests to contact me via email or phone.
