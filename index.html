        <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>Let me give you some information about my background. Eversince I was a kid, I was always fascinated with
            technology! It was so interesting to be able to grow up in a time where we first were introduced to the
            world wide web! How fascinating was it to see you can be connected to the world via a computer! To be able
            to go the web and search on a topic and get results instantly sure was amazing! As I got older, I was so
            intrigued with how web sites were build and so I learned the basic tags for building websites. Looking back
            at how "plain" the webpages were back then, compared to now with all the JavaScript and everything that adds
            a little more bang to the sites sure does show how much it as evolved over time. Now come present time and
            am looking for a career change. So I thought, why not go back into something I was passionate about when I
            was younger? So here I am! </p>
            <br>
        <p>I am currently a student at the UW Triology Bootcamp in a 6 months program for Full-Stack Web Development.
            Within the last 3 months, I have learned an abundance of topics from: HTML/CSS, JavaScript/jQuery/AJAX/JSON,
            APIs, Firebase, and now Node.
            <br>
            Here, you will find a few of my work that I have done during my course of study. </p>
